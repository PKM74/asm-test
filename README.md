## x86 ASM Test
it does basically nothing, just a bootloader pretty much
bootloader is based on a VERY early version of Nanite's (https://github.com/PKM74/Nanite) bootloader
should just check the time, thats it sooo basic i know quite literally wrote this in like 2 days. 
Doubt i'll ever touch it again, i'd rather focus on Nanite, a much more complete project.
So don't bother me about it, some odd bug? maybe it just doesn't compile at all?? i'm not fixing it, i genuinely do not care.
